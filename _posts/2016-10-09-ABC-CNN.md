The paper introduces a state of the art architecture for visual question answering (VQA). Given an image and an image related question, VQA should return the answer in a natural language manner where it can be in a single word or a sentence. Since VQA is able to provide information understanding natural language questions and analysing contents of an image, it has a great use in applications like navigation for blind people, image retrieval and early education with children. VQA has been considered as a highly challenging task as it requires a machine to understand the natural language query, extract the features from an image and to build a relationship between the two in a unified manner. Current most improved VQA models generally contains three parts. A vision part to extract visual features from an image through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) or a traditional image feature extractor, a question understanding part to  understand a complex question through a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the answer generation part which outputs a single word answer (by a multiclass classifier) or a long answer (generated by an additional RNN decoder) conditioned on the visual features and the question. These approaches generally is not sufficient to make full use of the relationship between the vision part and the question part as they jointly project features from the whole image space and the semantic space into answer space. ABC-CNN mimics the human behavior of understanding an image related question where humans first look at certain focused regions of the image with regard to the intent of the question and give the answer. In the same way the ABC-CNN locates informative regions from an image based on the input question intent and give more accurate answers.
